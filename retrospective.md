# Final Project Retrospective

## Team Members
- Student 1: Jahren Hans Dayag
- Student 2: Jan Ryan Hidalgo

## 1. How did you divide the work between you and your partner?
To ensure an efficient and collaborative workflow, our team of two mutually agreed to divide project task based on preferences. We discussed the features through open communication then we selected two features that felt comfortable to work on.

## 2. What Git strategies or commands helped you most during the project?
One of the strategies that helped us throughout this project was the feature-branch workflow. Each of us created separate branches for individual tasks/features and this approach allowed us to work without interfering with each other's code and merging conflicts.

## 3. Describe a merge conflict you encountered. What caused it and how did you resolve it?
We encountered a merge conflict in the product_model.pseudo file, because we added a comment witout pulling the latest changes. The conflict occured on overlapping lines. Since the comment was intentionally added to simulate a merge conflict, we resolved the conflict by removing the comment.

## 4. What were the biggest challenges you faced as a team?
The biggest challenge we faced as a team was coordinating our work on the pseudo syntax design. Since we are two member contributing to different parts of the system using pseudo code, the syntax consistency in structure and logic flow became a challenge to us.

## 5. What did you learn about using Git in a collaborative setting?
The lesson we learned as a team was the importance of coordination and communication, especially when working on shared logic like pseudo code. Establishing shared guidelines, and proactively resolving issues helped us work more efficiently. We learned to pull and commit to stay aligned in the project.

## 6. How would you improve your workflow next time?
Next time, prioritizing clear coding and documentation standards from the start to avoid inconsistencies and confusion. This could be implemented by using collaborative tools like shared boards to strategize. 

## 7. Optional: Any feedback on the activity?
The experience on this activity helped strengthen our teamwork, coordination, and problem-solving skills. This activity highlighted our strengths and opportunities for growth. Each of us contributed effectively by taking ownershop of their assigned task to meet our goals.
